# Semantic-Textual-Similarity
NLP Project

The basic objective of the problem is to identify how similar the given two sentences
are. The similarity score takes an integer value between 1 and 5 (included). The
higher the score, the more similar the two sentences are.

In general, semantic textual similarity (STS) is a challenging problem; as it requires
both an understanding of lexical-level similarity, and the semantic composition of
the two chunks of text being analyzed. As a reference, here are some motivating
examples:


    Sentence 1: Birdie is washing itself in the water basin.
    Sentence 2: The bird is bathing in the sink.
    Score: 4
    Comment: Both sentences convey the message that a bird is taking a bath.
    

    Sentence 1: The young lady enjoys listening to the guitar.
    Sentence 2: The young lady enjoys playing the guitar.
    Score: 2
    Comment: Both sentences involve a lady and a guitar, but convey different actions
    i.e. listening to the guitar and playing the guitar respectively.
